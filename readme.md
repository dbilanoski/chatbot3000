## General info
As a part of my CS50x course certification, I decided to utilize OpenAI in my final project so I could learn additional and relevant technology. This chatbot application is fetching completions from OpenAI gpt 3.5 turbo model and persisting the data in the browser's local storage. It uses Netlify for deploying with serverless function to safely fetch from OpenAI and is styled in a retro cyberpunk fashion using plain css.

## Technologies
* Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Google fonts
* Netlify for deployment with serverless functions to safely talk to OpenAI
* OpenAI chat completion API with gpt 3.5 turbo model
* Vite server during developlment
